Android Explorer for OneDrive
=============================

A cleaner, simpler Microsoft OneDrive experience!

Android Explorer for OneDrive is a clean, free and ad-free client for OneDrive.

Supports batch uploading and downloading, renaming, deleting, copying and moving.

Play audio, video and view images in-app and download everything else to open in a supported installed app with a click of the notification.

OneDrive sharing functionality is also supported. Files shared with the user can be reached via a menu option, and sharing links for both read and read+write can be generated and shard through any supported app.
